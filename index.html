        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest, I have had a lot of exposure to the world
          of technology via companies like Microsoft and Amazon. I was first introduced to 
          coding in middle school where I got my hands on JavaScript through KhanAcademy. From there, 
          my love for coding grew to include C#/C++, Java, Python, and even some redstone and command block 
          circuitry in Minecraft. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If I am not coding or taking notes in class, I am probably spending time with my family or friends, 
          playing baseball, learning how to bowl 2-handed, solving one of my Rubik's cube puzzles, or throwing 
          knots into my yo-yo.

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <h3>DVD Logo Game</h3>
        <p>
          What is more exciting than watching the DVD logo hit the corner of the screen? How about using that 
          knowledge to garner some bragging rights! The DVD Logo Game allows you to do just that. Go head-to-head 
          with some friends (or even some strangers if you are feeling confident) to see who can choose the safest 
          place to be as the DVD logo traverses the screen. Everyone will pick a location to place their icon 
          before the DVD logo starts moving. Once it does, it will go and eliminate each player it comes into 
          contact with. The last player standing wins!

        <h2>Simon project</h2>
        <p>
          What could be better than having your favorite childhood memory game on the web to play at your 
          convenience? Done as a demo for my CS260 class, this project gives you just that.
